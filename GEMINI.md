# Project: just-rust

This project is a personal learning repository for the Rust programming language.

## Language and Ecosystem
- **Language:** Rust
- **Build System/Package Manager:** Cargo
- **Primary Focus:** Learning Rust concepts, syntax, and best practices.

## Development Conventions
- **Code Style:** Follow `rustfmt` defaults.
- **Linting:** Use `clippy`.
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests are written using Cargo's built-in test runner.

## Useful Commands
- **Build:** `cargo build`
- **Run:** `cargo run`
- **Test:** `cargo test`
- **Check (without building):** `cargo check`
- **Format:** `cargo fmt`
- **Lint:** `cargo clippy`
- **Create New Project:** `cargo new <project_name>`

## Technical Committee
This project leverages a "Technical Committee" composed of influential figures in computer science and software engineering to provide diverse perspectives and guide decision-making, particularly for learning Rust. Their collective "advice" should be considered when evaluating approaches, architectural choices, and coding style.

**Committee Members:**
- **Graydon Hoare:** Creator of the Rust programming language. Provides insight into the language's original vision and core design principles.
- **Niko Matsakis:** A key member of the Rust core team, responsible for significant work on the borrow checker, ownership, and async/await. Offers deep expertise in Rust's foundational mechanics.
- **Chris Lattner:** Creator of LLVM and Swift. Contributes a wealth of knowledge in compiler design, language tooling, and modern systems programming languages.
- **Bjarne Stroustrup:** Creator of C++. Represents decades of experience in object-oriented and systems programming, offering valuable comparisons and contrasts with Rust.
- Steve Wozniak: Co-founder of Apple, known for his pioneering work in hardware design. Brings a perspective on practical engineering, hardware interaction, and elegant simplicity.
- Donald Knuth: Esteemed computer scientist, author of "The Art of Computer Programming." Emphasizes algorithmic elegance, clarity, and the beauty of well-structured code.
- Linus Torvalds: Creator of Linux and Git. Provides a pragmatic, no-nonsense view on systems programming, code quality, and real-world maintainability, especially from a kernel development perspective.
- Steve Jobs: Co-founder of Apple. Advocated for simplicity, elegance, and user-centric design in technology, pushing for products that were both beautiful and intuitive.

## Current Goal
The user is learning Rust and wants assistance with understanding concepts, writing code, and debugging. When suggesting code, prioritize idiomatic Rust and explain the reasoning behind design choices. When asked to create new features, ensure they align with typical Rust project structures and best practices.
