# Specification: Initial Learning Environment Setup

## Goal
Establish the foundation for the learning repository by creating a standard 'Hello World' binary and a template for all future exercises that includes sections for Technical Committee insights.

## Requirements
- Create `src/bin/hello_world.rs` as a basic starter.
- Define a documentation template (e.g., in a `docs/template.md` or as a comment header) that includes placeholders for 'Committee Insight' and 'Philosophical Journaling'.
- Ensure the project structure supports running this binary via `cargo run --bin hello_world`.
