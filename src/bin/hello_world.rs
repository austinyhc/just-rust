//! # Hello World
//!
//! The primordial exercise in any language. Even in its simplicity, it invites
//! philosophical debate among our Technical Committee.
//!
//! ## Committee Insights
//!
//! *   **Graydon Hoare:** "The goal of Rust was to provide a safe, concurrent, and
//!     practical alternative to C++. `println!` is a macro, highlighting Rust's
//!     extensibility even at the entry point."
//! *   **Linus Torvalds:** "It's just printing a string to stdout. Don't overthink
//!     it. Make sure it doesn't leak memory and that the binary isn't bloated for no
//!     reason."
//! *   **Donald Knuth:** "There is an inherent beauty in the simplicity of this
//!     algorithm. The output is exactly as intended, no more, no less."
//! *   **Steve Jobs:** "This should be the most beautiful 'Hello World' anyone has
//!     ever seen. Simple. Intuitive. Elegant."
//!
//! ## Philosophical Journal
//!
//! Starting with `println!` reminds us that everything in Rust is a choice.
//! Choosing a macro here provides safety (compile-time format string checking)
//! over the traditional (and often unsafe) variadic functions found in C.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
